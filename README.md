# Deckless Games

A mirror of the code used for deckless games ([deckless.web.app/games.html](https://deckless.web.app/games.html)). This site provides a html/javascript interface for card games and a Firebase backend that enables multiplayer games. The project is under development (currently it only supports one game) but the hope is to continue expanding it.

## Using this code

You are free to make a copy of this project (I'll put a formal liscence up soon), run a duplicate site, etc. The site is hosted with Firebase, and most of the files can just copy over, but there is some work to setup the project, so checkout their [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/) to learn more. A few files also require minor editing to work (such as inserting your own API keys); more documentation about that should be coming soon.
